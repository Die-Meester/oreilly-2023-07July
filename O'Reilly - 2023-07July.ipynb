    "# What is a programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "When computers were first invented, they were based on the idea that high voltage = 1, and low voltage = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allowed them to create logic inside of the computer:\n",
    "- If we have two high-voltage inputs, then we'll have a high-voltage output (\"and\")\n",
    "- If we have at least one high-voltage input, then we'll have a high-voltage output (\"or\")\n",
    "- If we have high voltage, then we'll get low voltage. If we have low voltage, we'll get high voltage. (\"not\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these three ideas, we had the first computers. You just needed to wire together the logic in the right way. If you wanted to change the computer's logic, you needed to rewire it, or even make new components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after this started, people came up with the idea of programmable computers. The idea was that the hardware (the circuits) wouldn't change across tasks, but that we would write a program that could control a general-purpose computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "That raised the question: How do we write these instructions?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, we just used 1s and 0s. You can imagine that this was very tedious. Soon, people created programming languages. The idea was that you would write in one language, and then it would be translated into the 1s and 0s the computer needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are tons of programming languages out there:\n",
    "- C -- a \"low-level\" langauge, meaning that you're writing code that's very similar to the 1s and 0s\n",
    "- Lisp -- a \"high-level\" language, which was very abstract and let you think at a high level, without thinking about 1s and 0s at all\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level language. It tries to mask a lot of the hardware from you, so that you can think at a high level, and write programs that are more similar to natural language than to 1s and 0s.  The trade-off is that Python programs are much easier to write, much easier to debug, and take longer to execute than (say) C, C++, Java, and C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is more than 30 years old, and is now VERY VERY VERY popular, in such areas as:\n",
    "- Web applications\n",
    "- Devops\n",
    "- System administration\n",
    "- Natural language processing\n",
    "- Data science and machine learning\n",
